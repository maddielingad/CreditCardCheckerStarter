# Challenge Project: Responsive Club Website
## Project Goals
In this Codecademy project, I was tasked to optimize the verification process of credit card numbers using my knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time.

## Project Requirements
1. Create a function, validateCred() that returns true when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and false when it is invalid. This function should NOT mutate the values of the original array.
2. Create another function, findInvalidCards() that checks through the nested array for which numbers are invalid, and return another nested array of invalid cards.
3. After finding all the invalid credit card numbers, create a function, idInvalidCardCompanies(), that returns an array of companies that have mailed out cards with invalid numbers. This array should NOT contain duplicates.
